# Programming Languages Teaching at UC Davis (Spring 2024)

Welcome! This organization collects coursework in programming languages and related areas led by [Caleb Stanford](web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~cdstanford) (GitHub: [cdstanford](https://github.com/cdstanford)) at UC Davis.
You are probably looking for one of the courses I teach: see [list here](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~cdstanford/teaching/) for links or you can directly browse the repositories above.

If you're interested in programming languages research, check out the main [DavisPL](https://github.com/orgs/DavisPL/) organization.
